# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The datasest consists of data related to Kickstarter projects from the years 2009 to 2017. The purpose of this analysis is to analyze kickstarter projects and how well they did in terms of their launch date and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

For this analysis, I looked at theater projects and their outcomes in relation to their launch date (month).

I also looked at theater projects (plays) and compared their funding goals in relation to their outcomes to see if there were any patterns in terms of funding goals and outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The only challenge that I experienced was ensuring that the COUNTIFs formulas were correct and working properly. 

## Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Theater projects launched in May and June were the most successful i.e. late spring and early summer theater projects were the most successful.

The least successful projects were launched in December, which may be due to the fact that people have less disposable income to spend because of the Christmas holidays. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The most successful play projects were projects that had the smallest goals (under $1000). 

### Limitations and Recommendations 

The main limitation of this analysis is that I mainly focused on the outcomes of projects related to theater. For a deeper dive, the analysis can be expanded to examine the outcomes of projects outside of theater and the outcomes of projects by year.
